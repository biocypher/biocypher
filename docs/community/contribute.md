# Contributing to BioCypher

There are many valuable ways to contribute besides writing code. Thank you for
dedicating your time to making BioCypher better!

## Bug reports and enhancement requests

Bug reports and enhancement requests are an important part of making any
software more stable. We curate them though Github issues. When opening an
issue or request, please select the appropriate category and fill out the issue
form fully to ensure others and the core development team can fully understand
the scope of the issue. If your category is not listed, you can create a blank
issue.

The issue will then show up to the BioCypher community and be open to
comments/ideas from others.
