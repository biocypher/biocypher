Welcome to the BioCypher community! We follow open-source principles and
encourage any sort of contribution. We communicate on GitHub, where we also
organise our projects. For more informal discussions and updates, we have a
[Zulip channel](https://biocypher.zulipchat.com). Everybody is welcome!

## Our Community Zulip Channel

Some channels are public, others can be seen after joining the Zulip community
(free of charge).

- `#announcements`: Stay informed about seminars, workshops, and other events.
- `#help`: Ask questions and get help related to BioCypher ecosystem projects.
- `#general`: You can introduce yourselves, discuss ideas and share your work.
- `#development`: Exchange ideas about development of BioCypher ecosystem projects.

Why Zulip? We chose Zulip because it is a modern, open-source alternative to
Slack. It is organised by topics, which helps in keeping the discussions
focused. It also is free of charge for open-source and academic projects, which
means that they sponsor the cloud hosting for our channel (as for many other
open-source projects) - thanks!
