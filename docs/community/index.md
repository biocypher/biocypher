## Zulip Channel (kind of Forum card)

- `#announcements`: Stay informed about seminars, workshops, and other events.
- `#help`: Ask questions and get help related to BioCypher.
- `#general`: You can introducce yourselves, discuss ideas and shere your work.
- `#development`:

Why Zulip? We chose Zulip because it is a modern, open-source alternative to
Slack.It is organised by topics, which helps in keeping the discussions focused.
It also is free of charge for open-source and academic projects, which means
that they sponsor the cloud hosting for our channel (as for many other
open-source projects) - thanks!
