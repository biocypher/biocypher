<!-- TODO there are "basics-knowledge-graphs.md" and
"knowledge-graph-biocypher.md" to still consider, fill in, etc. I am not
particularly convinced we need to (or are able to, in fact) explain very basic
things without knowing the user's background. Some knowledge should be assumed,
and we can also link to external resources (even very general ones, like
wikipedia) for further reading. -->
