    "The main purpose of BioCypher is to facilitate the pre-processing of biomedical data, and thus save development time in the maintenance of curated knowledge graphs, while allowing simple and efficient creation of task-specific lightweight knowledge graphs in a user-friendly and biology-centric fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a toy example to familiarise the user with the basic functionality of BioCypher. One central task of BioCypher is the harmonisation of dissimilar datasets describing the same entities. Thus, in this example, the input data - which in the real-world use case could come from any type of interface - are represented by simulated data containing some examples of differently formatted biomedical entities such as proteins and their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two other versions of this tutorial, which only differ in the output format. The first uses a CSV output format to write files suitable for Neo4j admin import, and the second creates an in-memory collection of Pandas dataframes. You can find the former in the tutorial directory of the BioCypher repository. This tutorial simply takes the latter, in-memory approach to a Jupyter notebook."
