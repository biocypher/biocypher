        **Feature description**
          As a user, I would like the ability to export a graph in OWL (Web Ontology Language) format,
          similar to how pandas provides the `bc.to_pandas()`` function.

        **Motivation**
          Exporting graphs in OWL (Web Ontology Language) would enable seamless integration with other ontology-based datasets.
          This would enhance my research on Ovarian Cancer treatments by allowing me to merge and analyze structured knowledge
          from multiple sources. OWL's semantic capabilities would facilitate better data interoperability, reasoning, and inference,
          ultimately improving the accuracy and depth of my study.
