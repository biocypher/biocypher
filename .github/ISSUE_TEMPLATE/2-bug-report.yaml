        Please provide a clear and concise description of the bug.

        If applicable, include a minimal example that allows us to reproduce the error by running the code.
        It's crucial that the snippet is as short and focused as possible, so please remove any unnecessary code
        to help us debug efficiently. We will copy and paste your code, and we expect to see the same result as you did.
        Avoid using external data and make sure to include all relevant imports, etc. For example:

        ```python
        # All necessary imports at the beginning
        from biocypher import BioCypher

        # A succinct reproducing example trimmed down to the essential parts:
        bc = BioCypher()

        bc.write_nodes(nodes_generator())  # Note: the bug is here!
        ```

        If the code is too lengthy (though we hope it's not), feel free to place it in a public gist and share the link in the issue: https://gist.github.com.

        Instead of providing the expected results, please paste or describe the actual results you observe. If you encounter an error, include the error message along with the full traceback. It's helpful to wrap error messages in ```` ```triple quotes blocks``` ````.
