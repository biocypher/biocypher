"""
Create a property graph database for biomedical research applications.

Transforms ordered collections of biomedical entities and relationships
to BioCypher objects that represent property graph nodes and edges.

Todo:
    - Calls to the classes are independent, so there is no way to
      check directly; nodes can be created at any point in time
      previous to edge creation. We could require a pass of all
      the nodes in the graph when creating edges. Pro: this would
      also allow a check whether the existing graph adheres to
      BioCypher, at least in the node domain. If it doesn't,
      the call does not make much sense.
    - establish a dictionary lookup with the id types to be used / basic
      type checking of the input
    - translation of id types using pypath translation facilities (to be
      later externalised)
