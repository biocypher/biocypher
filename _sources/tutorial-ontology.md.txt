# Tutorial - Handling Ontologies

![Adapters and ontologies](figure_modularity.png)

BioCypher relies on ontologies to ground the knowledge graph contents in
biology. This has the advantages of providing machine readability and therefore
automation capabilities as well as making working with BioCypher accessible to
biologically oriented researchers. However, it also means that BioCypher
requires a certain amount of knowledge about ontologies and how to use them. We
try to make dealing with ontologies as easy as possible, but some basic
understanding is required. In the following we will cover the basics of
ontologies and how to use them in BioCypher.

## What is an ontology?
An ontology is a formal representation of a domain of knowledge. It is a
hierarchical structure of concepts and relations. The concepts are organized
into a hierarchy, where each concept is a subclass of a more general concept.
For instance, a *wardrobe* is a subclass of a *piece of furniture*. Individual
wardrobes, such as yours or mine, are instances of the concept *wardrobe*, and
as such would be represented as *Wardrobe* nodes in a knowledge graph. In
BioCypher, these nodes would additionally inherit the *PieceOfFurniture* label
from the ontological hierarchy of things.

```{note}

Why is the class called *piece of furniture* but the label is
*PieceOfFurniture*?

The Biolink model uses two different case notations for its labels: the
"internal" designation of classes is in lower sentence case ("protein",
"pairwise molecular interaction"), while the "external" designation is in
PascalCase ("Protein", "PairwiseMolecularInteraction"). BioCypher uses the same
paradigm: in most cases (input, schema configuration, internally), the lower
sentence case is used, while in the output (Neo4j labels, file system names) the
PascalCase is more suitable; Neo4j labels and system file names don't deal well
with spaces and special characters. We also remove the "biolink:"
[CURIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURIE) prefix for use in file names and
Neo4j labels.

```

The relations between concepts can also be organized into a hierarchy. In the
specific case of a Neo4j graph, however, relationships cannot possess multiple
labels; therefore, if concept inheritance is desired for relationships, they
need to be "reified", i.e., turned into nodes. BioCypher provides a simple way
of converting edges to nodes and vice versa (using the `represented_as` field).
For a more in-depth explanation of ontologies, we recommend [this
introduction](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/explanation/intro-to-ontologies/).

## How BioCypher uses ontologies
BioCypher is agnostic to the choice of ontology. Practically, we have built our
initial projects around the [Biolink
model](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/), because it provides a large
but shallow collection of concepts that are relevant to the biomedical domain.
Other examples of generalist ontologies are the [Experimental Factor Ontology](
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo) and the [Basic Formal Ontology](
https://obofoundry.org/ontology/bfo.html). To account for the specific
requirements of expert systems, it is possible to use multiple ontologies in the
same project. For instance, one might want to extend the rather basic classes
relating to molecular interactions in Biolink (the most specific being `pairwise
molecular interaction`) with more specific classes from a more domain-specific
ontology, such as the EBI molecular interactions ontology
([PSI-MI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/mi)).  A different project may
need to define very specific genetics concepts, and thus extend the Biolink
model at the terminal node ``sequence variant`` with the corresponding subtree
of the [Sequence Ontology](http://www.sequenceontology.org/). The [OBO
Foundry](https://obofoundry.org) collects many such specialised ontologies.

The default format for ingesting ontology definitions into BioCypher is the Web
Ontology Language (OWL); BioCypher can read ``.owl``, ``.rdf``, and ``.ttl``
files. The preferred way to specify the ontology or ontologies to be used in a
project is to specify them in the biocypher configuration file
(`biocypher_config.yaml`). This file is used to specify the location of the
ontology files, as well as the root node of the main ("head") ontology and join
nodes as fusion points for all "tail" ontologies. For more info, see the
[section on hybridising ontologies](tut_hybridising).

## Visualising ontologies
BioCypher provides a simple way of visualising the ontology hierarchy. This is
useful for debugging and for getting a quick overview of the ontology and which
parts are actually used in the knowledge graph to be created. To get an overview
of the structure of our project, we can run the following command via the
interface:

```{code-block} python
:caption: Visualising the ontology hierarchy

from biocypher import BioCypher
bc = BioCypher(
    offline=True,  # no need to connect or to load data
    schema_config_path="tutorial/06_schema_config.yaml",
)
bc.show_ontology_structure()

```

This will build the ontology scaffold and print a tree visualisation of its
hierarchy to the console using the treelib library. You can see this in action
in tutorial [part 6](tut_relationships) (`tutorial/06_relationships.py`). The
output will look something like this:

```{code-block} text
Showing ontology structure, based on Biolink 3.0.3:
entity
├── association
│   └── gene to gene association
│       └── pairwise gene to gene interaction
│           └── pairwise molecular interaction
│               └── protein protein interaction
├── mixin
└── named thing
    └── biological entity
        └── polypeptide
            └── protein
                ├── entrez.protein
                ├── protein isoform
                └── uniprot.protein
```

```{note}
BioCypher will only show the parts of the ontology that are actually used in
the knowledge graph with the exception of intermediary nodes that are needed to
build a complete tree. For instance, the `protein` class is linked to the root
class `entity` via `polypeptide`, `biological entity`, and `named thing`, all
of which are not part of the input data.
```

## Using ontologies: plain Biolink
BioCypher maps any input data to the underlying ontology; in the basic case, the
Biolink model. This mapping is defined in the schema configuration
(`schema_config.yaml`, see also [here](qs_schema-config)). In the simplest case,
the representation of a concept in the knowledge graph to be built and the
Biolink model class representing this concept are synonymous. For instance, the
concept *protein* is represented by the Biolink class *protein*. To introduce
proteins into the knowledge graph, one would simply define a node constituent
with the class label *protein*. This is the mechanism we implicitly used for
proteins in the basic tutorial ([part 1](tut_01_schema)); to reiterate:

```{code-block} yaml
:caption: schema_config.yaml

protein:
  represented_as: node
  # ...

```

(tutorial_ontology_extension)=
## Model extensions
There are multiple reasons why a user might want to modify the basic model of
the ontology or ontologies used. A class that is relevant to the user's task
might be missing ([Explicit inheritance](tut_explicit)). A class might not be
granular enough, and the user would like to split it into subclasses based on
distinct inputs ([Implicit inheritance](tut_implicit)). For some very common use
cases, we recommend going one step further and, maybe after some testing using
the above "soft" model extensions, proposing the introduction of a new class to
the model itself. For instance, Biolink is an open source community project, and
new classes can be requested by opening an issue or filing a pull request
directly on the [Biolink model GitHub
repository](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model). Similar mechanisms apply
for OBO Foundry ontologies.

BioCypher provides further methods for ontology manipulation. The name of a
class of the model may be too unwieldy for the use inside the desired knowledge
graph, and the user would like to introduce a synonym/alias
([Synonyms](tut_synonyms)). Finally, the user might want to extend the basic
model with another, more specialised ontology ([Hybridising
ontologies](tut_hybridising)).

(tut_explicit)=
### Explicit inheritance
Explicit inheritance is the most straightforward way of extending the basic
model. It is also the most common use case. For instance, the Biolink model
does not contain a class for `protein isoform`, and neither does it contain a
relationship class for `protein protein interaction`, both of which we have
already used in the basic tutorial. Since protein isoforms are specific types of
protein, it makes sense to extend the existing Biolink model class `protein`
with the concept of protein isoforms. To do this, we simply add a new class
`protein isoform` to the schema configuration, and specify that it is a subclass
of `protein` using the (optional) `is_a` field:

```{code-block} yaml
:caption: schema_config.yaml

protein isoform:
  is_a: protein
  represented_as: node
  # ...

```

Explicit inheritance can also be used to introduce new relationship classes.
However, if the output is a Neo4j graph, these relationships must be represented
as nodes to provide full functionality, since edges do not allow multiple
labels. This does not mean that explicit inheritance cannot be used in edges; it
is even recommended to do so to situate all components of the knowledge graph in
the ontological hierarchy. However, to have the ancestry represented in the
resulting Neo4j graph DB, multiple labels are required. For instance, we have
already used the `protein protein interaction` relationship in the basic
tutorial ([part 6](tut_relationships)), making it a child of the Biolink model
class `pairwise molecular interaction`. To reiterate:

```{code-block} yaml
:caption: schema_config.yaml

protein protein interaction:
  is_a: pairwise molecular interaction
  represented_as: node
  # ...

```

The `is_a` field can be used to specify multiple inheritance, i.e., multiple
ancestor classes and their direct parent-child relationships can be created by
specifying multiple classes (as a list) in the `is_a` field. For instance, if we
wanted to further extend the protein-protein interaction with a more specific
`enzymatic interaction` class, we could do so as follows:

```{code-block} yaml
:caption: schema_config.yaml

enzymatic interaction:
  is_a: [protein protein interaction, pairwise molecular interaction]
  represented_as: node
  # ...

```

```{note}

To create this multiple inheritance chain, we do not require the creation of a
`protein protein interaction` class as shown above; all intermediary classes are
automatically created by BioCypher and inserted into the ontological hierarchy.
To obtain a continuous ontology tree, the target class (i.e., the last in the
list) must be a real Biolink model class.

```

(tut_implicit)=
### Implicit inheritance
The base model (in the standard case, Biolink) can also be extended without
specifying an explicit `is_a` field. This "implicit" inheritance happens when
a class has multiple input labels that each refer to a distinct preferred
identifier. In other words, if both the `input_label` and the `preferred_id`
fields of a schema configuration class are lists, BioCypher will automatically
create a subclass for each of the preferred identifiers. This is demonstrated in
[part 3](implicit_subclass) of the basic tutorial.

```{caution}

If only the `input_label` field - but not the `preferred_id` field - is a
list, BioCypher will merge the inputs instead. This is useful for cases where
different input streams should be unified under the same class label. See
[part 2](merging) of the basic tutorial for more information.

```

To make this more concrete, let's consider the example of `pathway` annotations.
There are multiple projects that provide pathway annotations, such as Reactome
and Wikipathways, and, in contrast to proteins, pathways are not easily mapped
one-to-one. For classes where mapping is difficult or even impossible, we can
use implicit subclassing instead. The Biolink model contains a `pathway` class,
which we can use as a parent class of the Reactome and Wikipathways classes; we
simply need to provide the pathways as two separate inputs with their own labels
(e.g., "react" and "wiki"), and specify a corresponding list of
preferred identifiers in the `preferred_id` field:

```{code-block} yaml
:caption: schema_config.yaml

pathway:
  represented_as: node
  preferred_id: [reactome, wikipathways]
  input_label: [react, wiki]
  # ...

```

This will prompt BioCypher to create two subclasses of `pathway`, one for each
input, and to map the input data to these subclasses. In the resulting knowledge
graph, the Reactome and Wikipathways pathways will be represented as distinct
classes by prepending the preferred identifier to the class label:
`Reactome.Pathway` and `Wikipathways.Pathway`. By virtue of BioCypher's multiple
labelling paradigm, those nodes will also inherit the `Pathway` class label as
well as all parent labels and mixins of `Pathway` (`BiologicalProcess`, etc.).
This allows us to query the graph for all `Pathway` nodes as well as for
specific datasets depending on the desired granularity.

```{note}

This also works for relationships, but in this case, not the preferred
identifiers but the sources (defined in the `source` field) are used to
create the subclasses.

```

(tut_synonyms)=
### Synonyms
```{admonition} Tutorial files
:class: note

The code for this tutorial can be found at `tutorial/07__synonyms.py`. Schema
files are at `tutorial/07_schema_config.yaml`, configuration in
`tutorial/07_biocypher_config.yaml`. Data generation happens in
`tutorial/data_generator.py`.

```

In some cases, an ontology may contain a biological concept, but the name of the
concept does for some reason not agree with the users desired knowledge graph
structure. For instance, the user may not want to represent protein complexes in
the graph as `macromolecular complex` nodes due to ease of use and/or
readability criteria and rather call these nodes `complex`.  In such cases, the
user can introduce a synonym for the ontology class. This is done by selecting
another, more desirable name for the respective class(es) and specifying the
`synonym_for` field in their schema configuration.  In this case, as we would
like to represent protein complexes as `complex` nodes, we can do so as follows:

```{code-block} yaml
:caption: schema_config.yaml

complex:
  synonym_for: macromolecular complex
  represented_as: node
  # ...

```

Importantly, BioCypher preserves these mappings to enable compatibility between
different structural instantiations of the ontology (or combination of
ontologies). All entities that are mapped to ontology classes in any way can be
harmonised even between different types of concrete representations.

```{note}

It is essential that the desired class name is used as the main class key in the
schema configuration, and the ontology class name is given in the `synonym_for`
field. The name given in the `synonym_for` field must be an existing class name
(in this example, a real Biolink class).

```

We can visualise the structure of the ontology as we have before. Instead of
using `bc.show_ontology_structure()` however, we can use the `bc.summary()`
method to show the structure and simultaneously check for duplicates and missing
labels. This is useful for debugging purposes, and we can see that the import
was completed without encountering duplicates, and all labels in the input are
accounted for in the schema configuration. We also observe in the tree that the
`complex` class is now a synonym for the `macromolecular complex` class (their
being synonyms indicated as an equals sign):

```

(tut_hybridising)=
## Hybridising ontologies
A broad, general ontology is a useful tool for knowledge representation, but
often the task at hand requires more specific and granular concepts. In such
cases, it is possible to hybridise the general ontology with a more specific
one. For instance, there are many different types of sequence variants in
biology, but Biolink only provides a generic "sequence variant" class (and it
clearly exceeds the scope of Biolink to provide granular classes for all
thinkable cases). However, there are many specialist ontologies, such as the
Sequence Ontology (SO), which provides a more granular representation of
sequence variants, and MONDO, which provides a more granular representation of
diseases.

To hybridise the Biolink model with the SO and MONDO, we can use the generic
ontology adapter class of BioCypher by providing "tail ontologies" as
dictionaries consisting of an OWL format ontology file and a set of nodes, one
in the head ontology (which by default is Biolink), and one in the tail
ontology. Each of the tail ontologies will then be joined to the head ontology
to form the hybridised ontology at the specified nodes. It is up to the user to
make sure that the concept at which the ontologies shall be joined makes sense
as a point of contact between the ontologies; ideally, it is the exact same
concept.

```{hint}

If the concept does not exist in the head ontology, but is a feasible child
class of an existing concept, you can set the `merge_nodes` option to `False` to
prevent the merging of head and tail join nodes, but instead adding the tail
join node as a child of the head join node you have specified. For instance, in
the example below, we merge `sequence variant` from Biolink and
`sequence_variant` from Sequence Ontology into a single node, but we add the
MONDO subtree of `human disease` as a child of `disease` in Biolink.

`merge_nodes` is set to `True` by default, so there is no need to specify it in
the configuration file if you want to merge the nodes.

```

The ontology adapter also accepts any arbitrary "head ontology" as a base
ontology, but if none is provided, the Biolink model is used as the default head
ontology. However, it is strongly recommended to explicitly specify your desired
ontology version here. These options can be provided to the BioCypher interface
as parameters, or as options in the BioCypher configuration file, which is the
preferred method for transparency reasons:

```{code-block} yaml
:caption: Using biocypher_config.yaml
# ...

biocypher:  # biocypher settings

  # Ontology configuration
  head_ontology:
    url: https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/raw/v3.2.1/biolink-model.owl.ttl
    root_node: entity

  tail_ontologies:

    so:
      url: data/so.owl
      head_join_node: sequence variant
      tail_join_node: sequence_variant

    mondo:
      url: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mondo.owl
      head_join_node: disease
      tail_join_node: human disease
      merge_nodes: false

# ...
```

```{note}
The `url` parameter can be either a local path or a URL to a remote resource.
```

If you need to pass the ontology configuration programmatically, you can do so
as follows at BioCypher interface instantiation:

```{code-block} python
:caption: Programmatic usage

bc = BioCypher(
    # ...

    head_ontology={
      'url': 'https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/raw/v3.2.1/biolink-model.owl.ttl',
      'root_node': 'entity',
    },

    tail_ontologies={
        'so':
            {
                'url': 'test/so.owl',
                'head_join_node': 'sequence variant',
                'tail_join_node': 'sequence_variant',
            },
        'mondo':
            {
                'url': 'test/mondo.owl',
                'head_join_node': 'disease',
                'tail_join_node': 'human disease',
                'merge_nodes': False,
            }
    },

    # ...
)
```
